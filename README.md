# teststrategies-and-tools-for-java

> :warning: TOOD this tutorial is under development, don't use it at the moment

This repo is just a collection of best practices and tools with simple example snippets for the development of Java Applications.
It starts with the Teststrategy since often discussion are fought about tools without understanding the 
context and because more testing does not mean better testing.

Before to select the right tools, I recomment to setup a strategy.
A strategy starts with the risks and requirements.
The second step is to select the most effective approaches to cover these.

## Functional testing

TODO Testpyramid

Important tools are:

* Mockito
* Spock
* Restassured
* Hamcrest
* Junit
* TestNG

There are of course more tools.

## Non-functional tests

Apart from the functional aspects, non-functional requirements should be taken into consideration:

* Performance tests
* Security tests
* Failover tests
* Code quality checks

### Performance tests

I will showcase two tools to executre perfomance tests

* Gatling
* Jmeter

There are of course more tools.

### Security tests

I will showcase

* OWASPâ€™s Zed Attack Proxy

There are of course more tools.

### Code quality checks

I will showcase one tool:

* findbugs
* sonar

There are of course more tools.

### Failover tests

Let us speak about some tools within the Simian Army (https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy)

There are of course more tools.
